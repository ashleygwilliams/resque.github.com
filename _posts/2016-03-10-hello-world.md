Hello, world.

Resque’s website has been nonexistant for a long time, and posting Resque
information to my personal blog isn’t as good as having a Resque-specific
space. So here we are!

This blog will contain infrequent posts about Resque’s development. If you
use Resque, you will probably want to subscribe.

## Where Resque is at

We’re going to be releasing 1.26.0 soon, after two years. We were originally
working on Resque 2.0, but have decided to drop it, due to a lack of time.
When that decision was made, several people had plenty of time to work on
Resque, and were being paid for it, but that’s no longer the case. So future
development will be focused on maintaining 1.x.

If you would like to contribute to Resque, please [get in
touch](mailto:steve@steveklabnik.com). We would love to have you.
